      <p>Humble beginnings</p>
      <p>It all started when my mom signed me up for this after school program in
        the third grade. It was out of the blue, and the more that I think about it,
        I think it was just for me to stop watching TV after school (haha). I remember
        being so nervous in this class, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't know what this
        program was about. As it turns out, this program was a STEM program, and this was
        my first introduction to robotics and programming.</p>

        <p>
        As I was learning Scratch, I was amazed by the fact that I made this orange cat move across the screen. I realized, I could
        make this cat do anything (within the bounds of Scratch). From then on, I was hooked on the idea of programming. Just the
        idea of seeing the process of something being built, such as websites. That to me is very cool because it shows the hard work
        and determination that is being put into things like this.
        </p>

        <p>
        Though, that was the only instance of programming in my life up until high school.

        <p>
        Growing up as a first generation, low income person, I never really had the
        chance to explore and learn new things/opportunities.
        As I mentioned in my word vomit up above,
        I didn't know what programming was let alone computer science.
        My parents didn't know what computer science was, my elementary and middle schools
        didn't really have specific programs or exposure to programs like these.
        (It was only during my last year of middle school that they introduced the
        STEM program).
        </p>

        <p>
        What I'm trying to say is that I didn't really have the proper resources to
        properly learn about computer science. (High school was a mess, if you are
        interested to hear more, shoot me an email! I have a lot to talk about).
        When I stepped foot into college, all my peers had some sort of connection
        to programming. It was usually someone in their immediate family who are SWEs.
        </p>
        <p>
        But that didn't stop me, I always remember why I want to do this.
        I want to be able to create and design software/programs/technologies
        to benefit communities and individuals. I want to be able to make technology
        accessible to communities, such as the ones I grew up in.
